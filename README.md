# About

This is repository of my C++ Katas - short programming exercises.

# Katas
Each Kata is placed in separate directory with 4 files inside:
* README.md - this file contains instructions for Kata, given template for fill and source of Kata,
* solution.cpp - this file is actual my solution of Kata enclosed in a template frame,
* solution.hpp - exported interface and all include headers,
* unit_tests.cpp - unit tests, based on Catch2 framework.

# Project
There is also Project directory, where is located a template project for Clion. I'm using it for resolving Katas.
